She warned me that it is Friday and what's to do
She's gonna wet his lip on Jagger's shot
And wait 'til it's six o'clock to call her
So we can see each other
With his kisses cure all my damage
I marked my initials on his neck
If she moves it to I ask her to don't stop
Baby, whatcha gonna do?
She took a crazy pill
And put the other half in my mouth
And I touch her, and she touches me
She doesn’t want another, and I don’t want another
And now she owns the place, she gon’ knock it down(she gon’ knock it down)
If I get near another she says "Give it to me." (she says "Give it to me")
She took it out my mouth to smoke it
She knows that know we gon’ have a better time
I’m under her power, power (her power)
Even I don’t know what I drank, drank(what I drank)
She don’t stop moving it, moving it (she don’t stop, she don’t stop)
